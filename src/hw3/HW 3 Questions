Reverse Array:
    In this problem, you will write a function to reverse an array of integers. Your algorithm should use O(1) space
    beyond the input; any algorithms that use space not in O(1) will not receive credit. You may not use any library
    functions in this question; any solutions that do will receive zero credit. Implement the reverseArray method.

Balance Parentheses:
    In this problem, you will write a function to check if parentheses are balanced.
    More details are in the write up. Implement isBalanced.

Dogish:
    (a) (20 points) Define the method inDogish recursively such that it returns true if the word is in dog-ish and
    false if it is not. I left a dogishHelper method, which I guarantee you will need to recursively solve dogish.
    An iterative solution will receive no points.

    (b) (20 points) Define the method inXish that does the same logic of dog-ish but for some word X.
    The method returns true if the word contains all the letters in the word X. The solution must be recursive.
    An iterative solution will receive no points.
